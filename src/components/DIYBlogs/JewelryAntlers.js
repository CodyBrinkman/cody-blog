          This is one of those builds that started off with a simple idea and bloomed into something better than I could have ever imagined. And the more I do these builds, the more I find this happens. The lesson being: <strong>just get started, the creativity and ideas will reveal themselves along the way!</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>1. The idea</h3>
          This initial idea I had was a jewely holder. From there I Googled "unique jewelry holder" and saw a cool picture of someone using a tree branch to hang necklaces and bracelets off of. I was originally going to use this method, but then I saw a tree branch that reminded me a lot like an old deer antler I found as a kid and we have stored in my garage forever. And boom, idea tranformation #1: instead of a tree branch I would screw a single deer antler into a piece of wood.
          <br />
          <br />
          I do not live in that home anymore, so I immediately texted my dad to go into the garage and grab the antler for me. To my dismay, he checked high and low and could not find it. Little did I know this would be the best possible thing for this build. After expressing my disappointed it had been thrown away since I was gone, my mom let me know she works with somebody whose family are large hunters and she would ask if they had extra antlers laying around. Not only did they have extra antlers, but they had antlers still on the skull plate! And boom, idea transformation #2: instead of using a single antler I would use antlers still on the skull plate. Now I know the build was going to get a lot more involved as I have never done anything close to mounting antlers before. I used my best friends Google and Youtube and came across <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J6H5NMsoLQ'>this</a> video by Whitebone Creations Hunting and it looked like something my dad and I could handle.

          <h3>2. Prepping the antlers</h3>
          As you can see in the above image most of the hide was already gone so the first thing I did was clean the pedicle which is yellow stuff you see at the base of the antler. A flathead screwdriver did the trick. After that I put some dishsoap in warm water and used an old sock to clean it all. If the above doesn't work for you just give it a Google search and you will find plenty of ways to clean yours.

          <br />
          <h3>3. Securing to base</h3>
          After the antlers were sufficiently clean, I searched our garage for some scrap wood. My dad had some scrap oak from a recent project so I cut a small rectangle for my base, but any wood and any shape work because this wood will not be seen. In the video they cut some old plywood into a spade looking shape. This is one area I wish I would have done slightly different. As you can see in the below image, the base is too large. If I was doing this again, I would trim it down to more closely match the size of the skull plate. Having such a large base led to a lot of excess when forming the cement mix (as you will see in the next step).
          <br />
          <br />
          Once the wood base was cut a couple screws is all it took to secure. I had my dad hold the antlers in the proper orientation, and once we had it how we liked I drilled a couple pilot holes with a drill bit, and then followed with the screws. The only thing you are going for here is holding the antlers in the proper orientation - the cement mix in the next step is what will fully secure your antlers. Also, if you accidentally crack your antlers, no worries. Just use more screws to get it held how you like, and again the cement mix will secure it all. I hit the antlers with a couple coats of polyurethane for good measure. Not sure if recommended or needed but worked great for me.

          <br />
          <h3>4. Forming the cement base</h3>
          This step is one I had pretty much no previous experience with and was a little nervous going into. The goal is to form and shape a cement base for the antlers that will hold everything together and provide a surface for us to stretch the leather over. For this mix I followed the video and did 1 part cement and 1 part plaster of paris. I was able to buy both at my local home improvement store, The Home Depot to be specific, and it worked great. If you cannot get either of these products for some reason, I am sure a Google search will yield other mixtures that work.
          <br />
          <br />
          The ratio is 1:1 between cement and plaster of paris, and the amount to mix is up to your need. Two hand scoops of each were plenty for me. After taking these equal parts, I made sure to mix it up good in the bucket before adding the water. I kept adding water until the consistency was that of clay, and then started packing it into every spot I could. I recommend using cold water which will slow down the setting time of the mix. After it was completely covering the skull plate, my dad and I began removing any excess and shaping the surface with a putty knife. Don't feel like you must rush, but keep in mind you have 3-4 minutes before the mix really starts to set. Make sure to leave room around the antler's pedicles, but other than that there's really no rhyme or reason to it - just find any tools you think will be useful and keep trimming and shaping, and then smooth it over once the shape is what you want.

          <br />
          As I mentioned above, my wooden base was slightly too large, so my cement base was larger than it needed to be, but I am still really happy with how it turned out. And again, this is going to get covered so if it has small imperfections don't fret. I do recommend watching some online videos (specifically the one I linked above) before this step to get an idea of how it will go, but be creative and give it a shot!

          <br />
          <h3>5. Leather wrapping</h3>
          This step was the most time consuming, but also the most rewarding. The goal is to cover the cement base with something pretty. I used a piece of leather I got from a craft store, but you can use any material you have or find. I recommend thinking about where this piece will likely live once completed and plan your material around what will look good.
          <br />
          <br />
          I wish I could give some great wisdom here about getting this right every time, but it was truly just trial and error. I strayed from the video slightly here. In the video they lay the full Leather and trim it while gluing. Leather is somewhat pricey so to minimize needing to buy another piece I first got an old pair of jeans and used that to make a template. The difficulty will depend on the shape of your base and antlers. For mine, we first used a sharpie to mark around the base of the antlers. I then cut a line from the edge to the base of each antler and continued to trim around to get it as snug around the pedicle as possible. Mine was going against a wall so my main objective was to ensure the front looked good and I was able to put all the seams on the back. Your mileage may vary though. If it takes some time, don't worry. Go for a walk to clear your mind and keep working at it. It took my dad and I 3 tries to get it how we wanted. Once you get your golden template, trace it onto the leather and cut it out as accurately as you can. Dry fitting it to ensure it's exactly as you like, you're ready for the real thing!

          <br />
          The best advice I can give here is to relax. Depending on your material you can fidget it to hide any mistakes, and worst case you peel it off and start over. I also recommend having someone else to help for this step as they can hold the antlers while you move and glue. The two materials you will want are some sort of spray adhesive and a hot glue gun. Cover the base with the spray adhesive, then lay the leather on and start pulling. The adhesive should help hold the leather in place, and then pull the leather tight and use the hot glue to secure it on the underside of the base. If you have done upholstery before I imagine it is a similar process, just using hot glue instead of staples.

          <br />
          If you got it first time, good job! If not, who cares? Go get another piece, take what you learned, and give it another shot. This is the center focus of the piece, so make it look how you want it! Another nice touch you can do is take a different color leather and go around the antler pedicles. The video does a great job walking through this and it is easy to do and worth your time. Here is how mine turned out.

          <h3>6. Building the box</h3>
          For me making it to this step was a huge relief. All of the antler mounting was new to me, but working with wood is a lot more familiar. My plan was to have necklaces, bracelets, and rings hang on the branch, but I still needed a place for earrings and other miscellaneous items. My solution was just to frame a box and line it with a soft material. I encourage you to get creative here!
          <br />
          <br />
          I got a thin sheet of plywood for the base, and some more oak for the frame. I drew my dimensions on a piece of paper, cut the wood, and then used a nail gun and wood glue to secure the corners. As always, make sure your fingers are not behind the wood when using the nail gun. And no you're not alone, keeping the corners at 90 degrees when clamping is always tricky.

          <br />
          I am nowhere near an expert when it comes to finishing, but sanding, tack cloth, couple coats of stain, and poly hasn't let me down yet and is what I did here. Depending on the wood you used you probably want to follow a different process, but as with any project, Google is your friend!
          <Image name='stainingbox' caption='Figure 10: Finishing the box'/>
          <br />
          Lastly, I went back to the craft store and picked up a piece of drawer liner with adhesive on the back. I cut it with a razor, peeled, and stuck. Simple as that.
