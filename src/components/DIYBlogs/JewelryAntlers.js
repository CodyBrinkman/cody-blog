          This is one of those builds that started off with a simple idea and bloomed into something better than I could have ever imagined. And the more I do these builds, the more I find this happens. The lesson being: <strong>just get started, the creativity and ideas will reveal themselves along the way!</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>1. The idea</h4>
          This initial idea I had was a jewely holder. From there I Googled "unique jewelry holder" and saw a really cool picture of someone using a tree branch to hang necklaces and bracelets off of. I was originally going to use this method, but then I saw a tree branch that reminded me a lot like an old deer antler I found as a kid and we have stored in my garage forever. And boom, idea tranformation #1: instead of a tree branch I would screw a single deer antler into a piece of wood.
          <br />
          <br />
          I do not live in that home anymore so I immediately texted my dad to go into the garage and grab the antler for me. To my dismay, he checked high and low and could not find it. Little did I know this would be the best possible thing for this build. After expressing my disappointed it had been thrown away since I was gone, my mom let me know she works with somebody whose family are large hunters and she would ask if they had extra antlers laying around. Not only did they have extra antlers, but they had antlers still on the skull plate! And boom, idea transformation #2: instead of using a single antler I would use antlers still on the skull plate. Now I know the build was going to get a lot more involved as I have never done anything close to mounting antlers before. I used my best friends Google and Youtube and came across <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J6H5NMsoLQ'>this</a> video by Whitebone Creations Hunting and it looked like something my dad and I could handle.

          <h4>2. Prepping the antlers</h4>
          As you can see in the above image most of the hide was already gone so the first thing I did was clean the pedicle which is yellow stuff you see at the base of the antler. A flathead screwdriver did the trick. After that I put some dishsoap in warm water and used an old sock to clean it all. If the above doesn't work for you just give it a Google search and you will find plenty of ways to clean yours.
